						Some sample text:

					<p>
					<img src="images/church.jpg" style="float: right; width: 350px; padding: 5px;">
						Hatfield Heath Parish Council after experiencing more aircraft noise in the village than ever before expect that a full review of the decision to move the Dover Route onto the Clacton Route is held which will result in a reversal of the decision. The Parish Council has continually received complaints from villagers who have experienced a doubling of flights over the village.  <br>
						We do not consider the CAA consultation was adequate as it was wrong to discount the views of local villages and did not seek to engage with the public. We note that an independent review of the process of the consultation criticized the whole process and its' legitimacy. 
						<br>  
						The doubling of the aircraft traffic is not spread out during the day but concentrated into slots which meet the airlines needs not ours, that is early morning and evening. None of this was made clear in the NATS consultation. We were definitely not winners over this move of flight paths although we are an established large village. When over 80% of respondents were against the proposal, their views should have been taken seriously not brushed aside as â€˜nothing new'.  <br>

						We query who has actually benefited from less noise over this move, as our village has not, and seems to have had planes flying lower over the village than before. There has been no discussion of compensation for villagers whose quality of life and property values have been adversely affect by the flight path move. People have bought homes and chosen to live in this village based on the published flight path information and should not have been subjected to this increase in noise disturbance. We also have the continued night flight problem.  
						We would suggest vectoring and respite periods and feel that concentrating the noise is unfair.

						HATFIELD HEATH PARISH COUNCIL  
						Clerk to the Council:  Ernie Fenwick  2 Lea Hall   Dunmow Road Telephone: 01279 730770  Hatfield Heath    Bishops Stortford Email parishclerk@hatfieldheath.com Herts. CM22 7BL   
						We feel that the monitoring of aircraft movements needs to improve and need to point out the difficulties in reporting disturbances for many villagers as the noise complaint Freephone number has been switched off since the end of 2015. This makes it difficult for residents without internet access to complain.   <br>
						We are aware that the review will take place 12 months after the implementation of the change but have to make our opinions and those of our villagers at this time.   
						Yours sincerely
