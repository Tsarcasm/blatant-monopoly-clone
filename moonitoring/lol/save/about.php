<h2>About this website</h2>
<p>Let me take this opportunity to tell you a little bit about my website</p>
<p>This website is (I hope) made by Charles Lockie, not the "illuminati". It is really a nerdy playground for me, as I use it to test out things that I have learnt from school and a variety of places. Do not expect wonders, and do not hesitate to leave, it is probably for the best.</p>
<p>The two main websites I use for help are <a href='http://www.multiwingspan.co.uk'>multiwingspan</a> and <a href='http://www.w3schools.com'>w3schools</a>. Both of these websites are good for reference, and starting your own website. If you want to get yours online, follow my hosing guide.</p>
<p>My website is, of course, made by myself, using HTML, PHP, and a bit of Javascript. The styling is using CSS. If you want to learn more about these terms, go an look them up. Most of the content is mine, and I have 'borrowed' some items off other people. Due to the fact that some of the content on this site is not mine, but I say it is, if anyone 'borrows' mine, I will sue and TAKE YOU TO THE COURTS!</p>
