<p>Welcome to my website, the most draining, time consuming, dull area of my life! How exciting!</p>
<p>This website's time is limited - it will be shut down by the evil that is paid server hosting. We (I) at Charles Lockie Conglomerate are very sorry about this, and any complaints will not be taken seriously. Contact us (me) at wedonot.care@charleslockie.co.uk. We (I) are so so sorry. </p>
<p>Here is a bleak reminder of the ultimatum facing this great source for hatred.</p>
